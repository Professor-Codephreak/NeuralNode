# 🧠 NeuralNode Protocol

NeuralNode is an AI-driven, cryptographically-permissioned protocol for sovereign social spaces.

Rooms are minted as NFTs, generated by interaction resonance, and evolve as living nodes of communication, collaboration, or encrypted storage.

## 📦 Contracts

- `BubbleRoomV1.sol` – Basic participant-controlled room minting
- `BubbleRoomV2.sol` – Private, tradable, soulbound room tokens
- `BubbleRoomV3.sol` – Adds RoomTypes (LIVING, STORAGE, VAULT, etc), time-locked access, and encrypted storage CIDs

## 🧩 RoomType Behavior

| Type       | Behavior                                  |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| TEMPORARY  | Event/flash space, short lifespan         |
| LIVING     | Persistent social group                   |
| EPHEMERAL  | Auto-closes after inactivity              |
| ARCHIVAL   | Read-only, historical preservation        |
| INCUBATOR  | Evolves into LIVING if active             |
| SIGNAL     | AI/agent-only coordination                |
| STORAGE    | Static content/IPFS reference room        |
| TIMELOCKED | Unlocks in future                        |
| VAULT      | Lit-encrypted, wallet-gated file room     |

## 🔐 Features

- Role-based access: MEMBER, AGENT, MODERATOR
- Invite-only privacy support
- NFT-based room ownership (transferable or soulbound)
- On-chain + IPFS metadata for transparency
- Encrypted vault content via Lit Protocol
- Lit, Livepeer, NFT.storage compatible

## 🧬 Contract Metadata Example (BubbleRoomV3)

```json
{
  "name": "BubbleRoom",
  "description": "A dynamic, AI-generated NFT space for encrypted media, collaboration, and identity.",
  "image": "ipfs://Qm...BubbleOrb.png",
  "external_url": "https://neuralnode.xyz",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "RoomType", "value": "LIVING" },
    { "trait_type": "Creator", "value": "Professor Codephreak" },
    { "trait_type": "Encrypted Storage", "value": "true" }
  ]
}
```
Host this in IPFS or Pinata and point tokenURI here.

📦 ABI Generation
You can generate ABIs from the BubbleRoomV1/V2/V3.sol contracts using forge, hardhat, or Remix. If you want all three ABIs instantly:

🧾 CLI:
```bash
forge inspect BubbleRoomV3 abi > BubbleRoomV3.abi.json
```
